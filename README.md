# How to run it
From the file names:

Starfield_remake_by_nebula_v1.py → Main Python script.

.sln and .pyproj files → These are solution/project files usually created by Visual Studio, particularly when using the Python workload.

So, you’ve got a Python project that can be run either:

Through Visual Studio, if that’s what you're using.

From the command line or terminal, if you just want to run the .py file directly.

✅ Option 1: Run via Visual Studio (Recommended if using .sln/.pyproj)
Open Visual Studio.

Go to File > Open > Project/Solution.

Choose the Starfield remake by nebula v1.sln file.

Once it loads, make sure your environment is set up:

Install the Python development workload if you haven’t.

Make sure Python is installed (Visual Studio might prompt you).

Click the green Run/Play button or press F5.

✅ Option 2: Run via Command Line / Terminal
If you don’t want to deal with Visual Studio and just want to run the .py script:

Step 1: Install Python (if not already)
Go to python.org/downloads and install Python 3.x.

Step 2: Run the script
Navigate to the folder in your terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python Starfield_remake_by_nebula_v1.py
Or on some systems:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 Starfield_remake_by_nebula_v1.py
❗ Optional But Helpful:
You might want to check the script for dependencies (e.g., pygame, tkinter, etc.). If any are used, install them with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install <package-name>
